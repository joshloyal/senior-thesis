\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this report a search for the Standard
Model Higgs boson in the decay channel \HToZg, $Z \ra \ll$, where
$\ell = e$ or $\mu$, was conducted using proton-proton collisions recorded
with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The distribution of the difference \dm between 
the final state three-body mass \mllg and the di-lepton invariant mass \mll
is compared to Standard Model (SM) background expectations. No significant
deviation from the SM prediciton is observed and upper limits on the 
cross-section of a Standard Model Higgs boson with a mass between 120 and 150 GeV
are derived. For a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV, the observed upper limit
is \exclhiggs\ times the Standard Model cross-section.
